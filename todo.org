#+TITLE: Todo

* Developer experience
** See messages the server is receiving and sending
** Send a message from the repl
** See state from the repl
** There may be a way to get hot reloading faster
Seems kind of like it takes a moment for firefox to realize that the
websocket connect has been severed, maybe send a message from the server
to the frontend to retry connecting with a tiny delay?  Freakishly fast
hot reloading seems in grasp

* Building a weather forecast display
This will shake out how to use an API,
https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/TOP/31,80/forecast

* Building a registration form
This will help provide the building blocks for the checkout

** Sending messages on blur
** Handling a form submit

* Building a checkout
It should be possible to build a fully functioning, complicated checkout
process with this library.  Google maps for address autocomplete, stripe
for the payment processor.
