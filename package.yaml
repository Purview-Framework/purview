description: |
  A framework for building server rendered, interactive websites.

  It's inspired by Phoenix LiveView, React, Redux, and Redux-Sagas.

  The main points:

  * It's server side rendered and uses websockets to communicate HTML updates and to receive events.

  * State can be broken up into small components.

  * The approach is to provide useful atoms, with the user building up a kind of AST.

  * Attributes flow down to concrete HTML, events bubble up to state handlers.
